## Sound Classification Problem

- Classifying the cry of a baby into 4 classes namely:  Hunger , Tiredness, Discomfort , Belly pain

- This is a Machine Learning Approach towards Sound Classification 

- You can apply this to your own custom Dataset for any kind of Sound Classification

## Things You'll Need :

- Dataset
- MetaData file for Dataset


## Dataset Used

- I used a public Dataset and then collected some of my own data as well and combined it for the project.
-  Link to Dataset :    https://github.com/gveres/donateacry-corpus


## Steps

1. Feature Extraction
2. Creating Dataframe
3. Applying Test/Train Splits
4. Fitting Model on Training Data
5. Results (Model Score and Confusion Matrix)
